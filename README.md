# klotski

Optimal solution finder for klotski puzzle game

### KLOTSKI IS SO HARD

I couldn't solve some of the harder levels, and didn't want to cheat completely so thought it would be a fair compromise to make a solver.

### Run commands

compile with
`make klotksi`
run with
`./klotski`

to customize board, modify the board array in main there are some comments to help.
